This codebase was created to demonstrate a REST API built with **Kotlin + Ktor + Kodein + Exposed** including CRUD operations, routing, dependency injection and more.

The application was built with:

  - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as programming language
  - [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) as web framework
  - [Kodein](https://kodein.org/di/) as dependency injection framework
  - [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin) as data bind serialization/deserialization library
  - [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/) as mapper between types (annotation processor)
  - [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) as datasource to abstract driver implementation
  - [H2](https://github.com/h2database/h2database) as in-memory database
  - [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) as ORM framework
  - [Netty](https://netty.io/) as embedded application server
  
Testing:
 
  - [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
  - [mockito-kotlin](https://github.com/mockito/mockito-kotlin) to work with [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) in Kotlin
  - [ktor-web-test](https://ktor.io/docs/testing.html) to call endpoints in the integration tests
  - [jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) as code coverage library
